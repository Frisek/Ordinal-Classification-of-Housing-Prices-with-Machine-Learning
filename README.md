# Ordinal-Classification-of-Housing-Prices-with-Machine-Learning
## Ordinal Classification

This project aims to predict the price of housing using an ordinal classification approach based on machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this project contains several features related to the housing market, such as the number of rooms, the size of the property, the location, and the type of housing.

The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Then, an ordinal classification model is trained using different algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, to predict the price range of each housing instance.

To evaluate the performance of the model, several metrics are computed, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, using a cross-validation strategy. Additionally, the model's hyperparameters are tuned using grid search or random search to find the optimal values that maximize the model's performance.

Finally, the trained model is tested on a holdout dataset to assess its generalization ability and deployed as a predictive tool to estimate the housing prices given a set of features.

This project aims to provide a useful tool for real estate agents, homeowners, or buyers to estimate the price of a housing property based on its characteristics and location, facilitating the decision-making process and improving the accuracy of the price prediction.
